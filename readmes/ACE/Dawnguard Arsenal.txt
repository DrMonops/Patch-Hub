CHANGES
- Carries over changes that ACE makes to the Vigilants outfit.
- Combines changes made by both mods to DLC1DawnguardItemPerk [PERK:0200D83A]. 
- Four pieces of armor are required for the Matching Set perks, but only three pieces (boots, cuirass, gauntlets) are needed for the vampire-specific resistances.
- Adds WACCF keywords to all weapons, and adjusts weapon stats to align with WACCF.
- Increases Gold value of new Dawnguard Weapons to match Dwarven tier weapons.
- Significantly increases Gold value of Dawnguard Elite Weapons to match Glass tier weapons.
- Patch includes vanilla SE meshes of the Dawnguard Rune Axe and Rune Warhammer used specifically for the DA Elite weapons.
This resolves a conflict when using Dawnguard Arsenal alongside FrankFamily's Frankly HD Dawnguard Armor and Weapons and prevents the FF Rune Effect showing on these two Dawnguard Arsenal Elite weapons. It also creates a visible difference between the standard Dawnguard normal weapons (vanilla mesh) and DA Elite Weapons (FF mesh). They no longer look identical.
