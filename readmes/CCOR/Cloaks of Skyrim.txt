Cloaks of Skyrim - CCOR Patch Notes
===================================
This file modifies Cloaks of Skyrim by Nikinoodles and Nazenn (https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6369) for improved consistency with Complete Crafting Overhaul Remastered.

This is a .esp / ESL flagged file and won't take up a spot in your load order.

INSTALLATION
Both mods are required in order to use this file.
Install the original mod, enabling both the Cloaks.esp and Cloaks - Dawnguard.esp files.
  *NOTE: Unlike previous versions of CCOR, you should NOT delete or disable these esp files.  However, the "Cloaks - USSEP Patch.esp" file that comes bundled with Cloaks of Skyrim is not required; it can be deleted or disabled.
Load Cloaks of Skyrim after Complete Crafting Overhaul Remastered.

BANDOLIER, CLOAKS OF SKYRIM, AND WINTER IS COMING
The CCOR patches for Bandolier, Cloaks of Skyrim, and Winter is Coming use shared leveled lists to distribute the items to vendors and other NPCs.
If you've previously used these mods with older versions of CCOR, you'll find the distribution should be nearly identical.
If you also have Wet and Cold installed, distribution of some items will vary depending on the surrounding temperature.
The suggested load order for these mods and patches is:
   -Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.esp
   -Weapons Armor Clothing & Clutter Fixes.esp
   -Complete Crafting Overhaul_Remastered.esp
   -Dr_Bandolier.esp

CHANGES
- Added crafting menu filters and category conditions from CCOR SE.
- Added cloaks to vendor lists so they will appear in merchant inventories.
- Carried forward conflicting records from USSEP (included briarheart "armor" edit).
- Added "MagicDisallowEnchanting" keyword to Graybeard's cloak.
- Removed the ClothingNecklace and ArmorMaterialLeather/Hide keywords from cloaks and replaced with WAF_ClothingCloak.
- Restricted the types of enchantments that the player can place on cloaks to the "resist" enchantments.
- Weight, gold values, keywords, and enchantments were adjusted to be more consistent with other changes made by CCOR.
- Adjusted crafting recipes for better consistency with CCOR: replaced leather with FurPlate, adjusted linen quantities, and added inventory conditions.
- Removed sewing book & spinning wheel; all recipes now use the Tanning Rack.
- The copies of the unique Dragon Priest cloaks which were sitting on or near the altars have been removed.  The unique cloaks can still be looted from named Dragon Priests.


CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS
Once in game, you can use the following console commands to adjust the percent chance that a cloak will spawn on a certain type of NPC.  Note, that this number represents the chance that NONE will spawn, so if you want there to be a 25% chance that a cloak will appear, then use "75" for the command value.  Enter one of the following console commands, replacing the number with a value from 0 to 100:  
	set DIST_CIACloaksBanditBossChance to 55
	set DIST_CIACloaksBanditChance to 85
	set DIST_CIACloaksCommonChance to 65		(primary affects Orc strongholds)
	set DIST_CIACloaksCompanionsChance to 65	(affects members of the Companions faction)
	set DIST_CIACloaksForswornChance to 85
	set DIST_CIACloaksGreybeardsChance to 65
	set DIST_CIACloaksGuardChance to 35		(affects town guards and Dawnguard members)
