Immersive Jewelry_CCOR Patch Notes
===================================
This file patches Immersive Jewelry by Forteverum (https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5336) for improved consistency with Complete Crafting Overhaul Remastered.  This patch is primarily designed to update Immersive Jewelry's crafting recipes to work with CCOR's crafting categories and conditions.

INSTALLATION
Both mods are required in order to use this patch.  
Load Immersive Jewelry after Complete Crafting Overhaul Remastered.

CHANGES
- Added crafting menu filters and category conditions from CCOR SE.
- Added Smithing Skill Requirement conditions for silver and gold jewelry, which can be adjusted in CCOR's MCM.
- Added Elven Smithing as a perk requirement for a lot of the Quicksilver jewelry.
- Added quest conditions to Snow Elf jewelry.
- Added "Learning" conditions to Ancient Nord jewelry when it seemed appropriate.
- Made corrections in a few recipe conditions that may have prevented certain items from appearing correctly in the crafting menu.
- Carried over changes made by WACCF and CCOR to the vanilla armor and their crafting recipes.

OTHER NOTES
- Style categories could possibly be refined further.  Unless the item's Name or Editor ID clearly suggested a particular style, the jewelry was tagged as "Misc."  This general style category is probably correct for the majority of the jewelry, but there are probably some items that would be more appropriately conditioned under a specific style.
- Calcinium and Galatite were added to a small handful of recipes, but these two new metals from CCOR could probably be integrated even further with IJ.  Additionally, some of the new gemstones from CCOR could possibly be integrated into some of the IJ recipes.
- In testing, I noticed that there were a lot of jewelry items that were showing up in the Armor section of the crafting menu (using SkyUI's menu).  I suspect this is due to either the keywords or the body slots used for those items, which this patch doesn't change.  In most cases, these items still received the jewelry type conditions and will still respond to those filters, not the armor type/class filters.
