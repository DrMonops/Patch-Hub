Warmonger Armory Tweaks - Loremonger Edition - WACCF Patch Notes
================================================================
This file modifies Warmonger Armory Tweaks - Loremonger Edition Port by deletepch, Batmanna, and Duckzilla (https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35899) for improved consistency with Weapons Armor Clothing and Clutter Fixes.
Both of these mods are required in order to use this file. This is a .esp / ESL flagged file and won't take up a spot in your load order.

You do NOT need to use WarmongerArmoryLoremonger_WACCF_Patch.esp when using this CCOR patch. Please note that Warmonger Armory Tweaks - Loremonger Edition patches are not required for either the aMidianBorn Content Addon (AMB) or Armor and Clothing Extension (ACE).

Do NOT use with the patch for the Warmonger Armory - Unofficial Fixed SSE Port (WarmongerArmory_WACCF_Patch.esp).

- Added SPIKEWeapFancySwordBlack keyword to Dunmer Ebony Sword and Soul Ripper Sword.
