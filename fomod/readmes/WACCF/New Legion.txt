New Legion - WACCF Patch Notes
==============================
Compatibility and consistency patch for New Legion by NordwarUA (https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30468) and Weapon Armor Clothing and Clutter Fixes.
Patch by pytheian. This is a .esp / ESL flagged file and won't take up a spot in your load order.

CHANGES
-Applied all keywords (including Survival/Warmth and SPIKE keywords for use with Guard Dialogue Overhaul) on all armors, cloaks, weapons and the Imperial arrows.
-Balanced the base light & heavy variants to WACCF values.
-Balanced Chainmail medium between the light & heavy values.
-Made the higher tier Officer/Penitus Oculatus/Legate/General/Emperor gear stronger than the basic varieties, in line with both New Legion and WACCF.
-Balanced the new cloak gold/weight values to the CCOR patched version of the mod "Cloaks".
-Adjusted on leveled list to adjust the relative frequency of Legate helmets vs. Officer variety (and left very easy instructions on how to reverse this in the linked Google Sheet)
