Patch by bobbyclue, lifestorock, & Kelsenellenelvian. This is a .esp / ESL flagged file and won't take up a spot in your load order.

DO NOT use with the SIC Improved Closefaced Helmets patch (SIC - ICH Patch.esp) available from lifestorock's SIC SE - Add-Ons and Patches (https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54930), as the changes from that patch have been included in this one.
