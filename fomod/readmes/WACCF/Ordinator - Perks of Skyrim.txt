Ordinator_WACCF Patch Notes
===========================
Compatibility patch for Weapons Armor Clothing and Clutter Fixes and Ordinator (https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1137).
Allows Ordinator's changes to the Light and Heavy Matching Set perks to work properly with WACCF's keywords.

Not required if Ordinator_CCOR patch is used. This is a .esp / ESL flagged file and won't take up a spot in your load order.

Version 1.20 (02/26/2021)
-Updated Ordinator's Expert Smithing perk to reflect changes made by WACCF. The two options now provided by Expert Smithing are:
	-Smithing: Advanced Light - You can create Scaled items at a forge or anvil, and improve them twice as much. (NOTE: This is also used by many faction armors, including Dark Brotherhood, Nightingale, and Thieves' Guild.)
	-Smithing: Advanved Heavy - You can create Orcish, Nordic, and Plate items at a forge or anvil, and improve them twice as much.

Version 1.11 (12/10/2019)
-Removed some extraneous records that would show up as ITMs.

Version 1.1 (12/10/2019)
-Adjusted Trick Arrow damage for consistency with WACCF and added Material keywords.
