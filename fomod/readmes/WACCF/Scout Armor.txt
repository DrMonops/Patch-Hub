Scout Armor - WACCF Patch Notes
===============================
This file modifies Scout Armor SE by doodaboom, ported by DirtyWeaselMedia (https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18910), for improved consistency with Weapons Armor Clothing and Clutter Fixes.
This is a .esp / ESL flagged file and won't take up a spot in your load order.

INSTALLATION
Both of these mods are required in order to use this file.
Load Scout Armor after Weapons Armor Clothing and Clutter Fixes.

CHANGES
- Rebalanced all items so armor is closer to Scaled and weapons are closer to Nordic in power.
- Modified recipes and conditions to reflect the balance changes.
- Copied over the gravity and speed stats for the Scout Arrow projectile record.
- Added alternate recipes for Hooded Helmets (requires both a Scout Helmet and Scout Hood in inventory for recipe to show).

CHANGE LOG
Version 1.0 (2021/06/20) - Initial release.
