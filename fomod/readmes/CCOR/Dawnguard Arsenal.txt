CHANGES
- Adds crafting menu filters and category conditions from CCOR SE.
- Adjusts crafting recipes to better reflect CCOR's formula and materials. 
- Adds breakdown recipes for all Dawnguard weapons.
- Dawnguard Elite weapons now use Galatite ingots and require the Advanced Heavy perk in order to craft and improve them.
- Allows Dawnguard Arsenal weapons to be crafted at any forge, unless CCOR MCM option is enabled to restrict crafting to the Dawnguard Forge.
- Additional weapon damage from Dawnguard Weapons will now reflect changes that CCOR makes to the Silver weapon perk as well as any adjustments made via the CCOR MCM settings.
- Includes all changes from the DawnguardArsenal_WACCF_Patch.
	- Combines changes made by both mods to DLC1DawnguardItemPerk [PERK:0200D83A]. 
	- Four pieces of armor are required for the Matching Set perks, but only three pieces (boots, cuirass, gauntlets) are needed for the vampire-specific resistances.
	- Adds WACCF keywords to all weapons, and adjusts weapon stats to align with WACCF.
	- Increases Gold value of new Dawnguard Weapons to match Dwarven tier weapons.
	- Significantly increases Gold value of Dawnguard Elite Weapons to match Glass tier weapons.
	- Patch includes vanilla SE meshes of the Dawnguard Rune Axe and Rune Warhammer used specifically for the DA Elite weapons.  This resolves a conflict when using Dawnguard Arsenal alongside FrankFamily's Frankly HD Dawnguard Armor and Weapons and prevents the FF Rune Effect showing on these two Dawnguard Arsenal Elite weapons. It also creates a visible difference between the standard Dawnguard normal weapons (vanilla mesh) and DA Elite Weapons (FF mesh). They no longer look identical. https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19663
