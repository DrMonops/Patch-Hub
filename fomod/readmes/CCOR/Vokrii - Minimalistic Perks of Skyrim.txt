Vokrii_CCOR Patch Notes
=======================
This file combines changes made by Vokrii (https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26176) and Complete Crafting Overhaul Remastered.
Both of these mods are required in order to use this file.

Specifically, this file:
-Adds CCOR Crafting conditions to Vokrii's recipes for armor padding and plates, as well as breakdown recipes for said items.
-Allows Vokrii's High Yield Mining perk to work with CCOR.
-Incorporates the changes to the Matching Set perks from Umgak's Vokrii-WACCF patch (https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26278).
NOTE: Umgak's Vokrii-WACCF patch is not required if you are using this patch.

This is a .esp / ESL flagged file and won't take up a spot in your load order.

Credit to Umgak for the changes to the Matching Set perks.
