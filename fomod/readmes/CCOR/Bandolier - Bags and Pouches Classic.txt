Bandolier - CCOR Patch Notes
=============================
This file modifies Bandolier-Bags and Pouches by Dragten (https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2417) for improved consistency with Complete Crafting Overhaul Remastered.

This is a .esp / ESL flagged file and won't take up a spot in your load order.

INSTALLATION
Both of these mods are required in order to use this file.
Install the Bandoliers, Bags and Pouches. 
Load Dr_Bandolier.esp after Complete Crafting Overhaul Remastered.
*NOTE: Unlike previous versions of CCOR, you should NOT delete or disable the esp file.


CHANGES
- Distributes the items in leveled lists and has them appear on NPCs.
- Adds recipes for crafting Imperial Bandoliers and Pouches, conditioned on joining the Imperial Legion.
- Recipes will sort into WACCF's crafting categories.
- Adds crafting menu filters and category conditions from CCOR SE.
- Recipes have been simplified to make them more consistent with other recipe formulas used by CCOR and to allow for reduced prices.
- Enchantments have been added to the book & vial holders.
- Item value has been reduced. This allows for better balance when finding them on NPCs, so it is not as easy to make money by scavenging them.
- Items are no longer weightless. This puts a small dent into the degree of carry weight benefit they provide, but it significantly improves the value/weight ratio balance for the items looted from NPCs.
- Items can no longer be disenchanted. The enchantment is intended to be a reflection of their inherent carrying capacity, not a magical property.

-Bandoliers with Shoulderpads are now called "Bandolier with Pauldron" and have armor rating and can be tempered.
   -These recipes have been moved to the forge.
   -They are considered light armor, but do not have the light armor keyword, so they should not impact any perks that rely on wearing, or not wearing, light armor.

- Conditions have been added to the recipes to help avoid crafting menu bloat:
   - Most Dark items require that you have Dark Leather in your inventory before they will show.
   - Dark Brotherhood items are conditioned off of quest stages and don't require finding a book.

- To further reduce menu clutter, approximately 60 recipes were removed from the crafting menu. Instead of having 2-6 recipes (one for each wearable position), there is only a single crafting recipe per pouch. 
   -When the player first equips the item, they can then choose how they want to wear it.
   -Once selected, the pouch will remember the selected equipment slot.
   -Dropping a pouch on the ground will reset it back to the generic version and allow you to change its position.


CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS
Once in game, you can use the following console commands to adjust the percent chance that a bag or pouch will spawn on a certain type of NPC.  Note, that this number represents the chance that NONE will spawn, so if you want there to be a 25% chance that a pouch will appear on an NPC, then use "75" for the command value.  Enter one of the following console commands, replacing the number with a value from 0 to 100:  
	set DIST_CIABandolierBanditBossChance to 85
	set DIST_CIABandolierBanditChance to 95
	set DIST_CIABandolierImperialChance to 95
	set DIST_CIABandolierDBChance to 75
	set DIST_CIAPouchCitizenChance to 90
	set DIST_CIAPouchBanditChance to 90
	set DIST_CIAPouchDBChance to 75			(for random Dark Brotherhood assassins)
	set DIST_CIAPouchHunterChance to 90
	set DIST_CIAPouchImperialChance to 90
	set DIST_CIAPouchMageChance to 90
	set DIST_CIAPouchNecroChance to 90		(for warlocks and necromancers)
	set DIST_CIAPouchVampireChance to 90


BANDOLIER, CLOAKS OF SKYRIM, AND WINTER IS COMING
The CCOR patches for Bandolier, Cloaks of Skyrim, and Winter is Coming use shared leveled lists to distribute the items to vendors and other NPCs.
If you've previously used these mods with older versions of CCOR, you'll find the distribution should be nearly identical.
If you also have Wet and Cold installed, distribution of some items will vary depending on the surrounding temperature.
The suggested load order for these mods and patches is:
