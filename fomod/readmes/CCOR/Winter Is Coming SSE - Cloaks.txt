Winter is Coming - CCOR Patch Notes
===================================
This file modifies Winter is Coming Cloaks by Nivea (https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4933) for improved consistency with Complete Crafting Overhaul Remastered.  Two different versions of this patch are included; use only one.  The "COS" version should be used if you also have Cloaks of Skyrim.

This is a .esp / ESL flagged file and won't take up a spot in your load order.

INSTALLATION
Both mods are required in order to use this file.
Install the original mod, selecting the main version (WIC Cloaks SSE) of the file. 
  *NOTE: Unlike previous versions of CCOR, you should NOT delete or disable the esp file.
If you are using Cloaks of Skyrim as well, you do not need the patch from the Winter is Coming page.  
Load 1nivWICCloaks.esp after Complete Crafting Overhaul_Remastered.esp.

- If you are using Cloaks of Skyrim, install 1nivWICCloaks_COS_CCOR_Patch.esp, and follow the load order recommended below.  
- If you are NOT using Cloaks of Skyrim, then install 1nivWICCloaks_CCOR_Patch.esp.

BANDOLIER, CLOAKS OF SKYRIM, AND WINTER IS COMING
The CCOR patches for Bandolier, Cloaks of Skyrim, and Winter is Coming use shared leveled lists to distribute the items to vendors and other NPCs.
If you've previously used these mods with older versions of CCOR, you'll find the distribution should be nearly identical.
If you also have Wet and Cold installed, distribution of some items will vary depending on the surrounding temperature.
The suggested load order for these mods and patches is:
   -Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.esp
   -Weapons Armor Clothing & Clutter Fixes.esp
   -Complete Crafting Overhaul_Remastered.esp
   -Dr_Bandolier.esp
   -Dr_Bandolier_CCOR_Patch.esp
   -Cloaks.esp
   -Cloaks - Dawnguard.esp
   -Cloaks_CCOR_Patch.esp
   -1nivWICCloaks.esp
   -1nivWICCloaks_COS_CCOR_Patch.esp
 
CHANGES
- Added crafting menu filters and category conditions from CCOR SE.
- Added inventory conditions to the crafting recipes, requiring that you have the primary component in your inventory.
- Added conditions to the temper recipes so that enchanted items couldn't be tempered without the arcane blacksmith perk.
- Removed Clothing keywords from helmets to allow them to sort properly in WACCF's altered vanilla crafting menu.
- Replaced ClothingNecklace and ArmorMaterialHide keywords on cloaks with WAF_ClothingCloaks.  Added this keyword to enchantment form lists (for the "resist" enchantments).
- Reduced the number of required Bear pelts from 3 to 1.  This allows a reduction in the cost of the cloaks.  New gold values are slightly higher than their raw material cost.
- Reduced the required Wolf pelts from 4 to 3 and increased the weight of the black wolf cloaks to 3.5 to match the timber/white wolf cloaks.  Reducing the number of pelts allowed the finished cloak to have a higher value and lower weight than the materials used to make it.
- Reduced the Snow Fox pelts required by the Rare Wolf cloaks from 3 to 1 to maintain consistency with the other cloaks.
- Removed charcoal from black wolf recipes. 
- Bear hood recipes now make 2 hoods.  This was to keep the cost ratio more in line with the other items.
- Increased the weight & armor of the Steel wolf hoods to match those of the steel helmet, and increased the weight of steel bear helmets to 6.
- Added WAF_ArmorFullLeather_KRY keyword to Leather helmets so they would work properly with WAF's altered matching set perk.
- Disabled the recipes to craft the "Refined" and "Enhanced" hoods to avoid stacking with CCOR's armored circlets.
- Added Survival_ArmorWarm keywords to fur hoods and hooded helmets.


CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS
Once in game, you can use the following console commands to adjust the percent chance that a cloak will spawn on a certain type of NPC.  Note, that this number represents the chance that NONE will spawn, so if you want there to be a 25% chance that a cloak will appear, then use "75" for the command value.  Enter one of the following console commands, replacing the number with a value from 0 to 100:  
	set DIST_CIACloaksBanditBossChance to 55
	set DIST_CIACloaksBanditChance to 85
	set DIST_CIACloaksForswornChance to 85
	set DIST_CIACloaksGuardChance to 35
	set DIST_CIACloaksHunterChance to 75
	set DIST_CIACloaksNecroChance to 65		(for warlocks and necromancers)
