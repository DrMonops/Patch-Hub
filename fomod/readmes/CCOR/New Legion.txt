-Balanced the base light & heavy variants to WACCF values.
-Balanced Chainmail medium between the light & heavy values.
-Made the higher tier Officer/Penitus Oculatus/Legate/General/Emperor gear stronger than the basic varieties, in line with both New Legion and WACCF.
-Balanced the new cloak gold/weight values to the CCOR patched version of the mod "Cloaks".

-Made all recipes CCOR Consistent"; updated tempering materials as appropriate.
-Added armored circlet options to most helmets.
-Adding missing breakdown recipes.
-Adding missing crafting recipes for the items New Legion adds.
