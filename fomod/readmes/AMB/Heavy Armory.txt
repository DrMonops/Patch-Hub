CHANGE LOG
Version 3.1 (2021-07-10) - Reverted animation type for Ancient Nord & Falmer daggers (to address invisible weapon issue and so they can be wielded by draugr/falmer); attached waf_weaponswapscript to swap them for new "dagger" versions added by WACCF. Updated crafting recipes accordingly.
