CACO_iNeed_Patch Notes
======================
This file contains small modifications to two of iNeed's scripts (_snplayeralias & _snquestscript) in order to correct an issue when using iNeed and Complete Alchemy & Cooking Overhaul together.  This change will prevent the player from receiving additional waterskins when exiting the cooking menu.  

To use: First install iNeed. If using iNeed - Extended, choose the "No Food/Recipe Changes" version. 
        Load Complete Alchemy & Cooking Overhaul after iNeed.  
	Allow the modified script included in this patch file to overwrite iNeed's original script. Note: There is no plugin incuded in this patch, just the single script.

Additional Information:
-----------------------
It is also recommended that you disable iNeed's option to alter the weight of food, as this can conflict with the changes made by CACO and result in some odd weight values. 

Also, iNeed's degradation system isn't recognized by CACO's food portion system, which results in some slight inconsistencies. For example, if you eat a loaf of bread which is considered stale by iNeed, the second half of the loaf is returned to your inventory as if it were a fresh piece of bread.
