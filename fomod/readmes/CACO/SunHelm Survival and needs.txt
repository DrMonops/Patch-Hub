SunHelm_CACO Patch Notes
========================
Compatibility patch for SunHelm Survival and Needs (https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39414) and Complete Alchemy and Cooking Overhaul.
With this patch installed, whenever you activate a cookpot or oven, any water you are carrying in SunHelm containers will be converted into CACO water tokens, allowing it to be used in cooking recipes.
Water containers can be refilled manually using newly added recipes.
Appropriate CACO and CCOR crafting conditions for Sunhelm's recipes are also added.
This is a .esp / ESL flagged file and won't take up a spot in your load order.
