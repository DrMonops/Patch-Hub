Hunterborn - CACO Patch Notes

Author: Teabag86

The ultimate goal of this patch is to make HB feel like a natural extension of CACO.
As much compatibility as possible has been built directly into the Hunterborn main file which reduces conflicts with other patches and allows for mixing and matching patches without issue.

Death Item Drops
Replaced some Hunterborn animal items with CACO items
Bear Heart swapped with Bear Bile (same effects)
Bears no longer drop animal fat, instead they will drop Bear Fat (ingredient)
Bull Horns (ingredient) removed and cows will now drop Horns (non-ingredient)
Ox Heart (ingestible) replaced with Oxgall (ingredient)(same effect as Bull Horns)
Dragon Hearts replaced with Dragon Teeth (same effects)
Added Fox Fat to fox material drop list
Eye of Fox effects changed to (Discerning, Fortify Stamina, Restore Health, Thrill)

HB Recipes requiring any of the above swapped out items have been updated with the equivalent CACO items; namely the potions Blood of the Hunt and Hircine's Cloak

Ingredients
All HB ingredients have been carefully adjusted to synch with CACO Effects and Values
28 CACO Ingredients added to Hunterborn Forage. These have been carefully distributed by region across Skyrim and Solstheim.

Portions added to unique HB meats to align with CACO meat portions
